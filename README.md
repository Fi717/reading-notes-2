#### Description of Growth Mindset

> A growth mindset means that you thrive on challenge, and see failure as a way for growth and developing your abilities. 


#### How to stay in a Growth Mindset

You can stay in a Growth Mindset by:

- Putting in the efforts
  >It's about drive, it's about power
    We stay hungry, we devour
    Put in the work, put in the hours and take what's ours
- Persist through failure
- Getting inspired by the success of others
